# Hiline: Empowering Change, Ending AIDS

Welcome to the Hiline Organization â€“ where technology meets advocacy, and innovation drives social impact. Our mission is to pave the way towards an AIDS-free Indonesia by 2030 through education, awareness, and cutting-edge solutions.

## About Hiline

Hiline is more than an application; it's a movement for change. Our app is a dynamic platform designed to educate both the public and PLHIV (People Living with HIV/AIDS) about the intricacies of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). By providing accurate information and fostering open conversations, we're empowering individuals to make informed decisions and champion HIV prevention.

## Tech Stack

Our tech stack forms the backbone of our commitment to excellence:

- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend**: Kotlin 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis 
- **Deployment**: Docker

We believe in harnessing the power of technology to transform lives and society.
